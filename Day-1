Anatomy of an HTML tag :- 
     <p>        -------       <p>
{openign tag}  {content} {closing tag} 

<p id="myId"></p>
Attribute is a name value pair that is kind of a meta data about the element itself that it's being applied to. So in this example, we are assigning myId as the value of the id attribute. Each attribute has its own rules for the meaning of its value. So for example, id attribute, being assigned as an example, has to be unique within the scope of the entire HTML document. In other words, no other element of any kind in the webpage is allowed to have its id attribute equal to the string myID.
